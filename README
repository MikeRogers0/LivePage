LivePage is a developer tool which reloads website resources (such as CSS, LESS, HTML and JavaScript) as they change on the server, so you are always looking at the most up-to-date version of a web page. It can make developing websites a lot faster, by helping productivity.

Key features in version 1.3 are:
	* LESS support
	* Entire domains can be made live
	* file:// protocol is now supported

It's recommended you use this extension in a development environment (Such as XAMPP).
